# B3 Brand Guidelines
**Company Name:** Bricks, Blocks, and Bots
**Brand Mark:** B3
**Domain:** b3fc.org

## 1. Brand Core & Strategy
**Positioning:** B3 is a "Family Innovation Hub" functioning as a local micro-incubator for families. It sits at the intersection of play, technology, and real-world mentorship. 
**Mission:** To empower the next generation of makers and innovators by uniting passionate kids with supportive parents in a collaborative, tech-forward community.
**Taglines:** 
 * Primary: "Build. Learn. Connect."
 * Secondary: "Where play meets purpose."
**Vibe/Tone:** Curious, collaborative, forward-thinking, playful yet professional. It should feel like a Y-Combinator for families—a collaborative prototyping space rather than a daycare.

## 2. Target Audience Profiles
**The Builders (Kids):** * **Sweet Spot:** 6-to-12-year-olds. 
* **Characteristics:** Transitioning from unstructured play to logic-based systems. They love to play with Legos, master Minecraft, script Scratch games, wire basic Arduino/micro:bit hardware, and use Generative AI to build ambitious projects.

**The Mentors (Parents):**
* **Sweet Spot:** Professionals who believe in the potential of technology, artificial intelligence, and enterpreneurship as a way to foster agency in kids.
* **Characteristics:** They possess immense technical and leadership knowledge but lack a structured, engaging environment to pass those engineering principles on to their kids. They want active mentorship and joint learning, not a drop-off program.
* **Location Focus:** The Cedar Park and greater Austin tech corridor.

## 3. Visual Identity & Design System
**Logo Concept:** The 3D Isometric B3 Cube.
* Left Face: Stylized, geometric "B".
* Right Face: The number "3".
* Top Face: A subtle circuit-board node or smiling robotic eye.

**Color Palette:**
* **Builder Orange (Primary):** Bright, energetic. Evokes Lego bricks and creative enthusiasm.
* **Pixel Green (Primary):** Vivid emerald/neon green. Nods to Scratch/Minecraft and fresh ideas.
* **Circuit Blue (Primary):** Deep, electric cyan. Represents robotics, Arduino, and technology.
* **Space Gray & White (Secondary):** Clean, crisp backgrounds. Ensures the brand feels modern, premium, and trustworthy to tech-industry parents.

**Typography:**
* **Headers/Display:** Chunky, structural, geometric sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat Black, Russo One).
* **Body Copy:** Readable, friendly, rounded sans-serif (e.g., Nunito, Open Sans).

**Graphic Elements:**
* **The "Evolution" Line:** A motif where a solid line (brick) breaks into dotted squares (blocks) and turns into a glowing path (bot/circuit).
* **Photography Style:** High-contrast, candid shots of collaboration. Parent and child pointing at a laptop screen, mentors handing gears to students, close-ups of wired connections. Emphasize "fail forward" moments and debugging.

## 4. Curriculum & Program Pillars
1. **Bricks (Physical Foundation):** Tactile engineering using Lego and Lego Technic. Understanding structural integrity and gear ratios.
2. **Blocks (Digital Logic):** Software and systems thinking via Scratch and Minecraft (CAD and Redstone logic).
3. **Bots (Hardware & Integration):** Bringing code to life through physical computing using micro:bit and Arduino.
4. **AI Track (New Literacy):** Introducing artificial intelligence. Using block coding to train simple machine learning models and utilizing generative AI safely as a brainstorming partner.
5. **Entrepreneurship (The Application):** "Pitch Pods" where kids present projects to mentors, learning supply chain, budgeting, and public speaking.

## 5. Technical Website Guidelines (For GenAI generation)
* **Framework:** Generate components suitable for an Astro framework using the AstroPaper theme, deployed via GitHub Pages. 
* **Architecture:** Fast-loading, markdown-driven content structure.
* **Key Pages Needed:**
    * **Home:** Hero section with primary tagline, 3-pillar feature breakdown, and an email capture for the "Founding 50 Cohort" waitlist.
    * **About/Philosophy:** The dual-appeal mission (kids building, parents mentoring).
    * **Curriculum/Tracks:** Detailed breakdown of Bricks, Blocks, Bots, and the AI Track.
    * **Blog/Project Spotlight:** Markdown-friendly layout to showcase monthly kid projects, parent-mentor interviews, and local Cedar Park community events.
